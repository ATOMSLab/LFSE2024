# Lean for Scientists and Engineers, 2024

How would you like to, not just find and correct bugs in your code, but write code thatâ€™s provably free of bugs? How can rigorous, computer-checked logic be used in science, engineering, and AI? 

Lean 4 is a programming language whose type system enables it to check complicated math proofs. This ~22-hour lecture series is an introduction to Lean for non-mathematicians (we recommend a prerequisite of Calculus II). This was taught at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and online in Summer 2024.

Topics include:
1. Logic and proofs for scientists and engineers
2. Functional programming in Lean 4
3. Provably-correct programs for scientific computing
